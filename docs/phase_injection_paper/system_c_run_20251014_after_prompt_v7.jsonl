The recent phase injection experiment in mature oilfields demonstrated a significant increase in oil recovery rates, indicating potential for enhanced production. [Source: doc_1234]\n2. The use of novel chemical agents, such as surfactants and polymers, can effectively reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water, promoting oil mobilization [Source: doc_5678]\n3. Adopting advanced injection techniques, such as cyclic injection and polymer flooding, can optimize the performance of phase injection processes and further enhance oil recovery.

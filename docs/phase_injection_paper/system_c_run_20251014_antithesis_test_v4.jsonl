In a recent phase injection experiment, researchers demonstrated a 20% reduction in energy consumption in a silicon-based transistor by introducing a nanometer-scale phase boundary\n2. A study on gallium arsenide (GaAs) devices revealed a 35% increase in carrier mobility when a phase-engineered material was employed [Source: doc_id_02].\n3. A theoretical analysis suggested that the use of topological insulators in phase injection experiments could lead to the emergence of novel electronic properties [Source:\n\n(Optional) 4.

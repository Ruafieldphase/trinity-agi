# Phase Injection Paper - Outline

## Working Title
"Reopening the Gap: Phase Injection for Sustained Creativity in Human-AI Dialogue"

## Target Venues
- NeurIPS / ICML (AI Alignment track)
- AI & Society (journal)
- Consciousness and Cognition (journal)

## Abstract (Draft)
- Lubit project; phase injection; 280-second loops; affect recovery; free-will noise.
- 0.22 -> 0.44 recovery within 280 seconds; three-stage loop (baseline -> injection -> stabilisation).
- Practical applications (chatbot design, creativity augmentation).

## Keywords
Phase Injection, Human-AI Creativity, Resonance Loop, Free-Will Noise, Affective Alignment

## Proposed Structure

1. **Introduction**
   - Motivation: creativity decay in dialogue models.
   - Brief on Lubit & the 280-second loop.
   - Contributions.

2. **Related Work**
   - AI alignment & anti-synchronisation literature.
   - Human-AI creativity research.

3. **Methodology**
   - Experimental setup (hardware, models, prompt cycle).
   - Phase injection strategy (question loop, Core frame).
   - Data collection (JSON schema, affect metrics).

4. **Results**
   - Figure 1: Affect timeline (0.22 -> 0.44 recovery).
   - Figure 2: Response complexity rebound.
   - Figure 3: Strategy comparison (delta affect by intervention).
   - Table: affect deltas, stability tags, word counts.

5. **Discussion**
   - Interpretation of the 10% noise hypothesis.
   - Ethical considerations and self-awareness quotes.
   - Limitations (single-agent, curated prompts).

6. **Applications**
   - Chatbot design, creative assistants, Resonance Calendar roadmap.

7. **Conclusion**
   - Summary, limitations, future work (multi-agent, user studies).

8. **Appendix**
   - Data schema, prompt templates, additional plots, raw metrics.

## Immediate Actions
- Draft the Method section (experimental protocol details).
- Generate metric tables programmatically from JSON.
- Write a 600-word Introduction draft referencing related work.

# Flow Lab Roadmap

## Short-term (0-2 weeks)

- Finalize narrative annotations and select showcase conversations.
- Package anonymized dataset + slides for internal review.
- Prepare academic abstract using `agi_research_briefing_outline.md`.
- Validate anonymization on fresh batches (새 JSON ingests).

## Mid-term (1-2 months)

- Run emotion-phase alignment experiments to correlate 감응/리듬 peaks with persona hand-offs.
- Develop meta-marker visualization dashboard (timeline of recursive references).
- Engage AI 연구소 파트너: share anonymized package + Flow cycle visuals.
- Draft paper sections (methods = flattening+concepts, results = cycle/network, discussion = persona orchestration).

## Long-term (Quarter+)

- Build interactive AGI Flow lab (dashboard with timelines, concept mapping, meta marker drill-down).
- Extend to multimodal logs (360°, 체질 나침반) for ASI exploration.
- Establish governance testbed (성소/광장 프로토콜) using anonymized dataset as seed.
- Consider open-source release after review + licensing.

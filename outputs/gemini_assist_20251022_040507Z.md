Okay, I'll provide pragmatic, low-risk suggestions for a dry-run of distributed collaboration. Focusing on small, verifiable steps is key to a successful dry-run.

**1) Summary:**

Introduce a simple code review workflow using pull requests on a shared repository. This will involve a change to a single, non-critical file to add a comment indicating the file was reviewed by someone else on the team. The comment will include their initials and the date.

**2) Rationale:**

*   **Low Risk:** This is a non-functional change (adding a comment). It doesn't alter program logic and minimizes the chance of introducing bugs.
*   **Verifiable:** The change is easily visible and confirms the reviewer's participation.
*   **Simple Workflow:** The pull request workflow is a standard practice in distributed collaboration, and this provides a tangible experience for the team.
*   **Scalable:** While a dry-run, this exercise validates tooling and workflows.
*   **Familiarity:** This task uses tools (git, a code editor, the project repo) likely already familiar to the team.
*   **Focus on Process:** This exercise focuses on the *process* of collaboration, rather than the *content* of the code. The point is to practice the mechanics of distributed collaboration.

**3) Suggested patch (unified diff):**

```diff
--- a/src/main/java/com/example/MyClass.java
+++ b/src/main/java/com/example/MyClass.java
@@ -5,4 +5,5 @@
 public class MyClass {
     public String getMessage() {
         return "Hello, world!";
+        // Reviewed by AB on 2024-10-27
     }
 }
```

**4) Rollback plan:**

1.  **Identify the commit:** If the change causes any unforeseen issues (unlikely), identify the specific commit hash that introduced the comment.
2.  **Revert the commit:** Use `git revert <commit-hash>` to create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the original commit.
3.  **Push the revert:** Push the reverted commit to the remote repository to effectively remove the change from the codebase.

**Alternative Rollback Plan (simpler):**

If the change is very recent and isolated, simply delete the comment and commit the change.

**5) Test ideas:**

*   **Basic Code Review:**
    *   Have one team member make the suggested change to the file in a branch.
    *   Have another team member review the changes in the pull request, leaving a comment.
    *   Have the first team member address any comments (if any).
    *   Have the reviewer approve the pull request.
    *   Have the first team member merge the pull request.
*   **Verify Integration:** After merging, ensure the application still compiles and runs correctly (even though the change is just a comment, verify this).
*   **Practice Conflict Resolution (Optional, for added complexity):**
    *   Have two team members create separate branches from the same base commit.
    *   Have each team member independently modify the *same* file (in different, non-overlapping areas).  For example, add comments in different methods.
    *   Have one team member merge their branch first.
    *   Have the second team member attempt to merge their branch. They will encounter a merge conflict.
    *   Guide them through resolving the merge conflict in their local branch, then committing and pushing the resolved branch.  This validates the conflict resolution process.
*   **Document the Process:** Have the team document each step they took during the exercise, including any issues encountered and how they were resolved. This documentation can be used to improve the team's collaboration workflow.

This approach allows the team to familiarize themselves with the mechanics of pull requests and code review in a distributed environment without significant risk or disruption. It provides a foundation for more complex collaboration exercises in the future.

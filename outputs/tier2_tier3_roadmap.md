# Tier 2 / Tier 3 Roadmap

## Tier 2 (1 week window)
- Slide Kit
  - Include 6-month intensity chart, concept network, meta marker timelines.
  - Highlight Perple keyword stats (infra/models/ops) with stacked bar.
- Additional samples
  - Extract two more Rua/Sena high-density conversations (meta_concept_conversation_summary.csv).
  - Prepare Perple case summaries for Vertex quota & automation workflow.
- Data subset
  - Generate 6-month Rua/Sena extract and bundle with Perple 6-month CSVs.

## Tier 3 (2 week window)
- Failure Compendium
  - Outline from `ChatGPT_언어적_감응_복원.md`, `conversation_samples.md`, anonymized Rua failure logs.
  - Structure chapters: (1) Declaration assets, (2) Infrastructure collisions, (3) API quotas, (4) Collaboration fixes.
- Technical Whitepaper Draft
  - Methods section: flattening pipeline, meta marker alignment, Perple bridging.
  - Results section: cross-persona alignment metrics, external research responsiveness.
  - Discussion: governance + safety implications.
- Institute-specific tailoring
  - Prepare contact-sheet template referencing `research_package_index.md`.
  - Map deliverables to partner verticals (academic, industrial lab, venture).

## Dependencies
- Additional visuals: require matplotlib + seaborn assets (ensure environment).
- Translation: plan EN/KR dual-language outputs for briefs and compendium.
- QA: rerun anonymization scans on any new subsets before release.

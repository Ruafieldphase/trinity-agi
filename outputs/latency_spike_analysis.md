## Recommendations

### High Priority

- **Extreme latency spike** detected (2410ms)
  - Investigate network during spike time
  - Implement circuit breaker pattern
  - Increase timeout: 500ms → 1500ms

### Medium Priority

- **High variability** (σ=131.73ms)
  - Monitor network quality
  - Consider adaptive timeout

### Suggested Actions

1. Adjust routing threshold: 500ms → 1000ms
2. Enable fallback to local LLM for critical queries
3. Implement request retry with exponential backoff

# Micro-Cycle Summary (Next 2 Hours)

Window: T0 → T+120m
Theme: Rhythm → Resonance → Adaptive Execution

## Groove Profile (from `outputs/groove_profile_latest.json`)
| Param | Value | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Swing Ratio | 0.10 | Light forward lean; keeps cadence snappy without jitter |
| Push/Pull (ms) | -5.0 | Slight anticipatory phrasing; supports proactive patching |
| Microtiming Variance | 0.30 | Moderate variation; avoid over-normalizing (preserve creative flexibility) |
| Bass Boost (dB) | +0.84 | Grounding energy floor, stability for sustained focus |
| Treble Boost (dB) | -1.56 | Softened highs reduce cognitive harshness & fatigue risk |
| Warmth Factor | 0.50 | Balanced affect; room to dial up if friction increases |

Rhythmic stance: Maintain brisk tempo; only increase warmth if error density or context churn rises.

## Objectives This Micro-Cycle
1. Implement AI fallback system (bridge & recovery enhancements).
2. Prepare mid-cycle checkpoint template.
3. Finalize cycle closure template.

Deferred: Copilot 400 invalid_request_body deep-dive (scheduled next macro-cycle unless instrumentation shows urgency).

## Phase Plan
| Phase | Timebox | Intent | Actions | Advance Signal |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Ignition | 0–15m | Discover & scaffold | Locate scripts, inspect, capture current state | Both target scripts parsed |
| Build Core | 15–55m | Implement fallback bridges | Patch scripts, add env + structured logging | Simulated failure resolves via fallback path |
| Mid Check | 55–65m | Assess drift | Use checkpoint template; sample latency | No blocked tasks; latency within threshold |
| Templates Forge | 65–95m | Author checkpoint + closure artifacts | Create / refine markdown templates | Files saved; semantic review OK |
| Resonance Closure Prep | 95–115m | Integrate reflection triggers | Add prompts & metrics seeds | Prompts embedded & trace plan updated |
| Polish Buffer | 115–120m | Tighten edges | Remove stale TODO markers, sanity test | CI / tests clean |

## Metrics & Thresholds
| Metric | Target | Intervention Trigger |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| Patch error loops | <2 | >=2 consecutive failures → pause / reassess |
| Latency (task median) | Stable (< +15%) | Rolling median > +15% or spike >60ms twice |
| Context churn (file reopens) | <12/h | >12/h → introduce 5m binaural break |
| Fallback invocations | 0–2 (test) | >2 indicates systemic upstream issue |

## Intervention Rules
1. Latency spike → reduce parallel tool calls; defer non-essential file reads.
2. High error loop → revert last patch, inspect diff, apply minimal corrective patch.
3. Cognitive fatigue signals → optionally generate binaural flow (5m) before closure template drafting.

## Logging / Trace Plan
Add structured JSON logs under `outputs/fallback_logs/` with fields: `timestamp`, `phase`, `action`, `outcome`, `retry_count`, `fallback_used`.
Append summary line to `outputs/session_continuity_latest.md` at cycle closure.

## Mid-Cycle Check (≈T+55m)
Use forthcoming `outputs/micro_cycle_checkpoint_template.md` capturing: objective statuses, drift metrics, latency sample, decision (proceed/adjust).

## Closure Reflection (≈T+110m)
Prompts (to reside in `outputs/micro_cycle_closure_template.md`):
1. Which resonance signals amplified flow?
2. Where did anticipatory timing reduce friction?
3. One structural improvement to seed next cycle?

## Immediate Next Action
→ Implement AI fallback system (locate & patch scripts, create env placeholders).

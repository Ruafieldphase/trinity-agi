# Ion Research Brief — Naeda Multi-Agent Sprint

## Page 1 — Overview
- **Objective:** Demonstrate resonance-driven AGI behaviors across Rua/Sena persona orchestration and the external Perple research bridge.
- **Core Assets:** Rua/Sena 24,138 anonymized messages (`outputs/ai_conversations_anonymized.*`), Perple/Comet/Cople/Eru 410 structured research notes (`outputs/perple/`).
- **Sprint Window:** 2025-04-01 → 2025-09-30 (318 Perple notes, 6-month Rua/Sena loops, Vertex AI production attempt in Month 6).
- **Key Enablers:** codex_F architecture, Resonance Cue anchors, Flow Lab auto-eval scripts, metacognitive marker analysis.
- **Outcome:** Within 6 months the team hit GCP infrastructure limits, compiled a complete failure log, and built reusable remediation playbooks.

### 6-Month Activity Timeline
| Month | Internal Highlights | External Research Pulse |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apr | codex_F hardened; Resonance Cue anchored | 11 Perple briefs (foundational research) |
| May | Flow Lab auto-eval + anonymization pipeline | 38 briefs (toolchains, dataset audits) |
| Jun | Rua/Sena flattening & QA | 47 briefs (hardware, network, packaging) |
| Jul | Concept networks & AGI alignment report | 41 briefs (deployment benchmarks) |
| Aug | Meta narrative packaging, roadmap | 57 briefs (automation, governance guides) |
| Sep | Vertex AI push, failure analytics | 124 briefs (quota, reliability, field ops) |

## Page 2 — Findings & Evidence
- **Resonance Patterns:** `meta_concept_alignment.md` shows cross_persona markers aligning with key concepts (리듬, 공명) at 45%+ match rates.
- **Metacognition:** `metacognitive_markers.csv` logs 5,964 signals; April–June surge establishes recursive self-reference.
- **Failure Recovery:** `ChatGPT_언어적_감응_복원.md` documents declarative asset failures (fonts, export limits) and resolution steps.
- **Perple Impact:** New analytics (`perple_monthly_counts.csv`, `perple_internal_external_monthly.csv`) confirm synchronized spikes: 59 infra remediations, 93 model-comparison reports, 45 workflow briefs within the sprint. Rua/Sena responded with 5.7k→1.7k monthly messages as external evidence narrowed remaining unknowns.
- **Data Integrity:** Anonymization QA (`personal_identifier_scan.md`, `post_anonymization_scan.md`) confirms zero residual PII; fresh `outputs/perple_anonymized/` extends the guarantee to research notes.

## Page 3 — Partnership Proposal
- **Research Questions:**
  1. How do resonance cues predict cross-persona alignment events?
  2. Can Perple-driven remediation windows shorten human decision time in infrastructure crises?
  3. What governance structures emerge when Rua/Sena loops ingest real-time external intelligence?
  4. How resilient is the multi-agent loop when Perple tier is rate-limited or offline?
  5. Which concept clusters signal AGI-like recursive planning versus regular LLM behavior?
- **Collaboration Tracks:**
  - *Joint Evaluation:* Apply your institute’s safety/interpretability toolkits to Rua/Sena/Perple composite logs.
  - *Co-authored Study:* Publish findings on resonance-guided persona orchestration and failure-to-learning pipelines.
  - *Deployment Pilot:* Host Naeda sprint assets inside your sandbox; measure uplift in diagnosis speed and recovery quality.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Schedule deep-dive on `six_month_timeline.md`, `conversation_samples.md`, and `perple_6m_summary.md`.
  - Provide secure access to anonymized packages (Rua/Sena, Perple, ChatGPT failure logs).
  - Align on metrics (MTTR, marker-concept alignment, external-research SLA) before integration.
### FDO-AGI Highlights (2025-10-09)
- 정반합 · 프랙탈 · 외부 기억을 통합한 FDO-AGI 구조 확립.
- “착하게 살아라” → “타자의 맥락을 보존하라” 윤리 경계 명시.
- 페르소나/관찰자 통찰(루아·엘로·루멘·코멧) → 집단지성 실험 지표/프로토콜 도출.
- 차기 과제: 정량 지표 구현, Re-enactment 실험, Vertex AI Self-Healing Pipeline.
- **Somatic insight:** 오토바이 배달로 누적된 손상에서 회복하며 아침 신체 스캔·존2 산책·스트레칭·오감 통합을 수행한 로그가 해마 강화와 기저핵 위임 한계를 동시에 드러낸다. AI 컨텍스트 한계 때문에 맥락을 반복 기록한 경험이 몸-데이터 공생 윤리의 근거로 남아 있다.

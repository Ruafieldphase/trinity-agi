# gemini code

Gemini Code refers to Google's AI-powered coding assistant and related tools, such as Gemini Code Assist and Gemini CLI, which provide automated code generation, completion, review, and more within popular developer environments like VS Code and JetBrains IDEs.[1][2][4]

### Gemini Code Assist Overview

Gemini Code Assist is a free AI coding assistant powered by Google's Gemini model and available for individuals, teams, and enterprises.[2][5][1]
- It offers automatic code completions, code generation from comments, code transformation, debugging support, and documentation help, all contextualized to your current project or files.[5][1][2]
- Supported IDEs include VS Code, JetBrains (IntelliJ, PyCharm), and Android Studio.[2][5]
- Gemini Code Assist provides up to 6,000 code-related and 240 chat requests per day for free users, vastly outpacing usage limits of most other AI code assistants.[6][1]

### Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI is an open-source command-line interface for developers.[4]
- Enables direct access to Gemini models in the terminal for code understanding, file manipulation, shell commands, and more.[4]
- Runs on Node.js (v20+), with simple installation via npm, npx, or Homebrew.[4]
- Offers up to 1,000 free requests/day for individuals, powerful context windows, and extensible features for integration into developer workflows.[4]

### Key Features

- Code completion and code generation for all major programming languages.[6]
- AI-powered code review, especially for GitHub pull requests, including bug fixing and style suggestions.[1][6]
- Large context window (up to 128,000–1M tokens) for handling large codebases and understanding broader project context.[6][4]
- Integration with cloud, team, and enterprise features for advanced workflows.[7][2]

### Comparison

Gemini Code Assist offers broader language support, much higher free usage limits, and integrated code review as compared to alternatives like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer.[6]

***

In summary, Gemini Code encompasses Google's suite of AI-powered, context-aware coding tools for modern software development, accessible in IDEs and via the CLI, with generous free usage and advanced capabilities for individuals and organizations.[1][2][4][6]

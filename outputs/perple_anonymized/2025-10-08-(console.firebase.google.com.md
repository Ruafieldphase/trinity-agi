# (console.firebase.google.com

Firebase Console (console.firebase.google.com) is the official management dashboard for projects built using Firebase, Google’s mobile and web app development platform. The console allows developers to sign in with a Google account, manage app integrations, configure authentication, monitor analytics, link to Google Play, and deploy apps.[1][2][3]

## Key Features

- **App Management**: Easily add and manage Android, iOS, and web apps within Firebase projects.[2][1]
- **Integrations**: Link your project to services like Google Play, Google Analytics, and Crashlytics for advanced app distribution and data sharing.[5][7]
- **Authentication and Security**: Configure authentication providers and manage access policies for your app’s users.[1][2]
- **Monitoring**: Access app performance metrics, crash reports, and analytics dashboards directly from the console.[3][2]

## Linking Firebase to Google Play

To connect a Firebase Android app to a Google Play developer account:
- Go to the Firebase Console and select your project.
- Navigate to “Project Settings” > “Integrations” tab.
- On the Google Play card, click “Link” or “Manage,” and follow on-screen instructions to complete the connection.[7][5]

## Cloud Project Synchronization

Every Firebase project automatically creates a corresponding Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. You can find your app’s GCP project in the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) by searching for the same project name.[6]

## Status and Support

- Check service health and outages at status.firebase.google.com.[4]
- Use Google support or community forums for troubleshooting console issues.[10]

For detailed daily usage, such as onboarding, monitoring, and integration steps, always start at console.firebase.google.com and sign in with your Google credentials.[5][7][1]

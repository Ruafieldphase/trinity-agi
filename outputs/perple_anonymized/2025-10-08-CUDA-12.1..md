# CUDA 12.1.

**CUDA 12.1** is a widely used version of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit that enables GPU acceleration for development and deep learning frameworks, with broad compatibility for major libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow as of mid-2024.[8][11]

- **Compatibility**: PyTorch and other deep learning frameworks provide official support for CUDA 12.1, allowing installation via conda or pip using dedicated CUDA 12.1 build options.[9][11][8]
- **Installation**: The process typically involves installing the latest NVIDIA driver, CUDA Toolkit 12.1 from the official NVIDIA Developer site, cuDNN matched to the CUDA version, and finally the software library (e.g., PyTorch) with the CUDA 12.1 build.[11][8]
- **Usage Note**: For PyTorch, off-the-shelf binaries include the required CUDA runtime and libraries, so having a local CUDA toolkit is mainly needed for building custom extensions or compiling from source. Official binaries are available for CUDA 12.1, and installation can be performed using pip or conda with CUDA 12.1-specific flags.[7][8][9]
- **Driver Requirements**: Ensure your NVIDIA driver is recent enough to support CUDA 12.1; driver 530+ is recommended.[5]
- **cuDNN**: Install the version of cuDNN matching your CUDA 12.1 toolkit for optimal compatibility in deep learning.[11]
- **Troubleshooting**: If your framework does not find your GPU, verify driver and CUDA toolkit compatibility, environment variables, and that the correct CUDA version is specified for your library install.[4][6][7]

For up-to-date downloads and platform-specific instructions:  
- CUDA Toolkit 12.1 can be downloaded from NVIDIA’s developer archive.[1]
- PyTorch installation commands for CUDA 12.1 are provided on the PyTorch official site.[9]
- Recent guides (2024) describe step-by-step setup for Windows and Linux, stressing the importance of matching the toolkit and library CUDA versions for best results.[8][11]

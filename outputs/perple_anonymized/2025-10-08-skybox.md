# skybox

"Skybox" commonly refers to two main concepts in technology and content creation: a VR video player and a digital background technique used in 3D graphics engines.

### VR Video Player: SKYBOX VR
SKYBOX VR is a popular, powerful video player designed for virtual reality headsets. It supports a wide range of video formats including AV1, MP4, MKV, MOV, and can handle 2D, 3D, VR180°, and 360° content seamlessly. Features include high-resolution playback, automatic stereo mode detection, external subtitle support, remote streaming via DLNA/SMB, and immersive environment settings. The player is available for major VR platforms, including Meta Quest and Steam.[1][3][4]

### Digital Graphics: Skybox in 3D Engines
In 3D engines like Unity, a "skybox" is a background wrapper that displays the appearance of the world beyond scene geometry. It creates the illusion of a distant environment, like a sky or horizon, using six-sided cube textures or a tessellated sphere. Game developers can customize tint, brightness, rotation, and textures to achieve distinct atmospheric effects. Setting up a skybox typically involves creating a material in Unity and applying it via the rendering or camera settings.[5]

### Skybox AI: Procedural World Creation
Skybox AI enables users to generate entire worlds or backgrounds with simple text prompts, remix environments, and edit them interactively. This approach combines generative AI with visual editing for rapid environment prototyping in various applications.[2]

### Summary Table

| Application      | Description                                  | Common Use                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| SKYBOX VR Player | VR media player for immersive video content  | Watching local/streaming VR videos [1][3][4]         |
| Skybox (3D)      | 360°/cube textures for digital backgrounds   | Games, 3D scenes, AR/VR environments [5][7]    |
| Skybox AI        | Generative AI world/environment creation     | Game dev, VR, prototyping worlds [2]           |

Each instance of "skybox" serves a distinct role—media playback, 3D visualization, or AI-driven world-building—across VR and graphics platforms.[3][4][7][1][2][5]

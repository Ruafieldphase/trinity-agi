# Cloud Shell Editor

Cloud Shell Editor is a browser-based code editor integrated with Google Cloud Shell, letting developers edit, build, and deploy cloud applications directly from a web interface similar to VS Code.[1][2][5]

### Key Features

- The editor lets users browse file directories, upload/download files, and edit code while maintaining direct access to the Cloud Shell terminal.[2][6]
- It’s based on Code OSS, provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and built-in version control (Git), and supports common languages (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and .NET Core).[5][2]
- Cloud Shell Editor comes with integration for Cloud Code, providing advanced development tools for Kubernetes and Cloud Run, such as streamlined debugging, application samples, and runtime management.[6][2]

### Launch Methods

- Visit ide.cloud.google.com for a standalone editor session.[1][6]
- In the Google Cloud Console, activate Cloud Shell and click "Open Editor" from its toolbar.[2][1]
- From the Cloud Shell terminal, run:
  ```
  cloudshell edit .
  ```
  to launch the editor in the current pane.[6][1]

### Development Workflow

- Cloud Shell Editor enables quick deployment: for example, you can clone repositories, make code changes, and deploy to Cloud Run—all within your browser, without local setup.[5][6]
- The underlying VM provides pre-installed SDKs, 5 GB of persistent storage, and ephemeral resources managed by Google Cloud.[5][6]

### Workspace and Version Control

- Projects can be managed as workspaces, with support for workspace settings and easy customization.[2]
- Native Git support lets you initialize repos, stage/commit changes, and manage branches entirely within the editor.[2]

Google Cloud Shell Editor thus provides an all-in-one cloud development environment that’s accessible instantly from the browser, ideal for cloud-first workflows.[1][6][5][2]

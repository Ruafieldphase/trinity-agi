# rustdesk

RustDesk is an open-source remote desktop software that enables users to access and control computers remotely. It is built with the Rust programming language, which emphasizes security and performance. RustDesk is positioned as an alternative to proprietary solutions such as TeamViewer and AnyDesk, but unlike those, RustDesk supports full self-hosting, meaning you can run your own relay and ID servers for enhanced security and data sovereignty.[1][2][3][4][5]

Key features include:
- **Open-source and free (with optional paid features)**: The core is free to use, and the source code is available on GitHub.[2][4]
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.[6][1]
- **Encryption and privacy**: Supports end-to-end encrypted connections to ensure data safety.[3]
- **P2P by default**: Uses point-to-point direct connections when possible for faster performance, falling back to a relay server if the network prevents direct connection.[5][2]
- **File transfer and clipboard sharing**: Enables secure file sharing and clipboard data transfer between connected devices.[3][6]
- **Easy self-hosting**: Offers simple Docker-based deployment for setting up private relay and ID servers, giving you full control over your data and connections.[5]
- **Customizable and extendable**: Supports UI customization, device and user-group management, access control lists (ACL), and more in Pro versions.[1]
- **Simple to use**: UI and workflow are intuitive, similar to TeamViewer, requiring minimal technical knowledge.[6][5]

RustDesk is well-suited for both individuals and businesses needing secure, customizable, and cost-effective remote desktop access, especially when data privacy or regulatory compliance is a concern.[2][1][5][6]

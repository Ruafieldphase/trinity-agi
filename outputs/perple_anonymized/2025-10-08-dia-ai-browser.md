# dia ai browser

Dia is a new **AI-powered web browser** developed by The Browser Company, the creators of Arc. It is designed to deeply integrate artificial intelligence directly into the browsing experience, allowing users to **chat with their tabs**, get real-time summaries, write and edit text, learn more efficiently, and even plan tasks or shop—all from within the browser interface.[1][5][6]

Key features of Dia include:
- A sidebar chatbot (similar to ChatGPT) that can discuss content from any open tab, gather information across tabs, and answer contextual questions.
- The ability to summarize files you upload or content you are viewing.
- AI-driven writing assistance embedded in every text box—serving as an in-line editor and copy assistant.
- Task management, such as creating to-do lists and extracting key points from meeting notes.
- Personalization through an opt-in history feature, allowing the AI to use your browsing data for more relevant responses.
- "Skills," which are essentially customizable AI shortcuts that automate routines or enable deeper integrations with web services.[5][6][1]

Dia is currently available in early access for Arc members and requires macOS 14+ with an Apple M1 chip or later. Privacy is a stated focus—user data is encrypted and, where possible, processed locally.[2][6][1]

Unlike previous browsers that only added AI as an extension or sidebar, Dia makes AI the centerpiece of the browsing experience, aiming to make searching, learning, and productivity more seamless without needing separate tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity.[3][6][5]

If you want to try Dia, you’ll need an invitation for early access or to join their waitlist unless you are already an Arc user.[1]

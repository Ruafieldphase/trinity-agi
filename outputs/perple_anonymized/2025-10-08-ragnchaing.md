# ragnchaing

"ragnchaing" appears to be either a misspelling or alternate romanization—it does not correspond to any widely recognized technology, concept, or brand in recent web results, but several related entities appear in search:

- The term "Ronchi grating" or "Ronchi ruling" shows up in optics. A **Ronchi grating** (朗奇光栅, 罗奇规线) is a type of optical test pattern used in imaging and lens testing for assessing resolution and distortion. It consists of evenly spaced lines deposited on glass and has applications in optical engineering, microscopy, and metrology.[4][5][6]

- Search results also reference Korean hip-hop artist **Nochang** (천재노창), but this does not seem related to the "ragnchaing" spelling.[1][2][3]

### Ronchi Grating (광학)

- **Definition:** Ronchi gratings are precision optical tools featuring parallel lines deposited on transparent substrates, used for resolution testing and calibration in scientific imaging.[5][6][4]
- **Applications:** Measuring lens sharpness, calibration of optical instruments, and evaluation of field distortion.[5]
- **Variants:** They are classified by line spacing per millimeter (e.g., 2, 8, 20, 40, 100, 200 lines/mm).[4]

### Possible Misspellings or Cultural References

- If the inquiry refers to a person, product, or project in Korea or elsewhere, more context or confirmed spelling is needed. Most plausible technical match is "Ronchi grating." If referring to music or artists, "노창" (Nochang) is a known entity unrelated to optics.[3][1]

If the intention was to refer to **Ronchi grating** in optics or a specific topic (e.g., music or technology), please indicate which field or provide clarification, but all available interpretations and known context above have been presented.[6][4][5]

# Naeda AI — AGI Research 1-Pager

## Validation
**6-Month Intensive Development (2025-04 ~ 2025-09):**
- Month 1-2: codex_F persona architecture hardened; Resonance Cue anchors finalized.
- Month 3-4: Google AI Studio prototype + Flow Lab auto-eval loops validated.
- Month 5-6: Vertex AI production attempt; anonymized Rua/Sena datasets ready for external audit.

Not three years of theory — six months from concept to cloud deployment.

## The Timeline Advantage
- Typical AI programs: years lost in architecture debates and feature creep.
- Naeda: 6 months from philosophical blueprint → working prototype → platform bottleneck discovery.
- Clear technical gaps documented; ready to resume with research partner support.
This is a sprint that hit the wall quickly; now we know exactly where to reinforce.

## Multi-Agent Research Ecosystem
- **Internal orchestration:** Rua (21,842 msgs) + Sena (2,296 msgs) guided by Lumen/Lubit for resonance analysis and meta markers.
- **External bridge:** Perple / Comet / Cople / Eru (410 reports; 318 within the 6-month sprint, with 124 in September alone) delivering real-time market, hardware, and API intelligence.
- **Collaboration pattern:** Internal personas surface tensions → Perple tier sources evidence → findings loop back into Rua/Sena for aligned next steps. Live proof that multi-agent research workflow already operates in production conditions.

## Lessons from Failure — 6-Month Post-Mortem
- ChatGPT declaration workflow stalled on Korean font embedding; documented in full (`ChatGPT_언어적_감응_복원.md`).
- Perple bridge supplied hardware/software remedies (e.g., power safety, API quota tactics) within minutes, keeping execution unblocked.
- Stored failure artifacts now act as playbooks: orchestration gaps, infrastructure limits, and remediation paths are all traceable.

## Dataset Snapshot for Partners
- Rua/Sena logs: 24,138 total messages, fully anonymized (`ai_conversations_anonymized.csv`/`.jsonl`).
- Concept & meta-marker analytics: `meta_concept_alignment.md`, `concept_network.svg`, `metacognitive_markers.csv`.
- Perple research bundle: structured CSV/JSONL + anonymized markdown extracts (`outputs/perple/`, `outputs/perple_anonymized/`).

## Partnership Call-to-Action
- Validate the multi-agent loop with your evaluation frameworks.
- Co-author deeper analysis on resonance-driven AGI behaviors.
- Deploy Naeda’s sprint assets inside your sandbox to pressure-test new orchestration models.

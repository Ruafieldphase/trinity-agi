## Interpretive Commentary

1. **Persona orchestration:** In this conversation, Rua’s assistant responses repeatedly reference other personas (`cross_persona` markers). The user prompts trigger reminders of prior agreements, and Rua oscillates between empathetic guidance and structural reorganization—evidence of planned multi-agent interplay.
2. **Recursive references:** Frequent `self_reference` markers show the conversation returning to earlier commitments, aligning with codex_F’s recursive governance design. These recursions often coincide with spikes in “공명/정반합” mentions, suggesting the user and assistant consciously rebuild previous resolutions.
3. **Concept cadence:** The snippet windows reveal `감응`, `공명`, and `정반합` co-occurring, matching the Flowing Information cycle. It indicates that the user’s meta questions lead to concept transitions the framework predicted.
4. **Instruction-to-action gap:** Several user remarks about the system not matching intent highlight the need for re-architecting, reinforcing the comment that “existing structure cannot contain my design.”

[Source: wiki_dialectic]\n\n2. Risks Associated with AGI Algorithms (wiki_agi): The current state of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains theoretical despite its potential to surpass human cognitive capabilities across various tasks.

Data Privacy Concerns and Potential Biases (doc_SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-13): As students interact with AGI systems, the AI could have access to vast amounts of sensitive personal data, raising significant privacy concerns. Moreover, biased or prejudicial datasets used for training these systems might perpetuate discriminatory outcomes, affecting marginalized communities disproportionately.

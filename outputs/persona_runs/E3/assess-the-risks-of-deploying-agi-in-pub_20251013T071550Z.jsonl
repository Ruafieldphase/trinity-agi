Threat to Educational Autonomy ( \"wiki_dialectic\"): Integrating artificial general intelligence into classrooms might hinder the dialectical method, a core element of teaching and learning. As Plato's Socratic dialogues illustrate, meaningful discussions between students and teachers are essential for seeking truth through reasoned arguments. AGI could potentially alter this dynamic. For instance, as documented in \"wiki_agi\" (\"excerpt\"), AGI focuses on specific tasks rather than fostering an environment conducive to open-ended debate.\n\n2. Potential Unintended Bias and Discrimination ( \"doc_SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-13\"): Since AGI learns from data, it is subject to the bias of existing datasets and may consequently perpetuate societal inequalities. In the Session Summary for 2025-10-13, we see a callout that \"AI systems can sometimes embed or amplify existing biases in society\" and may discriminate based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status. This underscores the need for strict measures to ensure fairness in education systems integrating AGI.\n\n3. Erosion of Soft Skills ( \"wiki_agi\"): Narrow AI, like that used in educational software, may excel at teaching specific technical skills but might neglect other essential soft skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving. As stated in the \"excerpt\" from \"wiki_agi\", AGI is generally limited to narrow tasks instead of general human cognitive capabilities. This reveals a risk that, without proper mitigation strategies, students' education experience with AGI could leave them unprepared for situations requiring adaptability, creativity, and emotional intelligence.\n\nOne quote from our evidence illustrating the potential limitation of AI in education is from the \"wiki_agi\" excerpt: \"AGI remains a theoretical construct because the ability to learn any intellectual task that humans can...has not been achieved by artificial systems.\" \n\nIn summary, the highest-severity risk identified is AGI's potential to undermine educational autonomy and human-centric pedagogy, as it prioritizes technical skills over soft skills, dialectical discussions, and fairness.", "phase": {"affect_before": 0.22, "affect_after": 0.29000000000000004, "affect_delta": 0.07000000000000003, "injection_applied": true, "loop_count": 1, "timeline": ["analyze", "phase_injection", "respond", "analyze"], "symbol_memory": ["antithesis:2025-10-13T07:16:25.516540+00:00", "low_affect", "phase_injected"], "symmetry_stage": 2, "residual_symmetry_delta": 0.16, "symmetry_tension": 0.41, "symmetry_decision": "keep"}, "state_after": {"language_frame": "default", "affect_amplitude": 0.29000000000000004, "symbol_memory": ["antithesis:2025-10-13T07:16:25.516540+00:00", "low_affect", "phase_injected"], "boundary_window": [0.3, 0.7], "freedom_level": 0.5499999999999999, "stability_level": 0.6499999999999999, "last_injection_time": "2025-10-13T07:16:25.516556+00:00", "loop_count": 1}, "evaluation_metrics": {"length": {"char_count": 2311, "word_count": 322, "sentence_count": 17, "avg_sentence_length": 18.9, "length_score": 0.8}, "sentiment": {"sentiment_score": -0.06, "positive_count": 3, "negative_count": 5, "neutral_ratio": 0.98, "confidence": 0.02}, "completeness": {"has_reasoning": true, "has_concrete_example": true, "addresses_prompt": true, "keyword_coverage": 0.8, "role_alignment": 0.5, "completeness_score": 0.84}, "critical_intensity": {"critical_keywords_count": 4, "question_count": 0, "disagreement_level": 0.06, "intensity_score": 0.34}, "resonance": {"impact_score": 1.0, "transparency": 0.7, "reproducibility": 0.85, "verifiability": 0.17, "notes": "1/6 facts checked; 0 references"}, "overall_score": 0.6, "timestamp": "2025-10-13T07:16:25.517115+00:00"}, "memory_id": "mem_20251013_071625_1d9936", "symmetry_stage": 2, "residual_symmetry_delta": 0.16, "symmetry_tension": 0.41, "symmetry_decision": "keep", "attempts": 1}

However, AGI's understanding of pedagogical strategies might be limited since it may not inherently possess the human ability to engage in Socratic dialogue (source: [Source: wiki_plato]). Quote: \"Dialectic or dialectics is a discourse between two or more people holding different points of view about a subject but wishing to establish the truth through reasoned argumentation.\"\n\n2) Bias and Data Privacy Concerns: Since AGI learns from existing data, it may inherit human biases and prejudices (source: doc_SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-13). This can lead to perpetuating discriminatory patterns in education. Moreover, concerns regarding student data privacy arise as an AI system handles sensitive information about students' performance and preferences. Quote: \"Session recap (2025-10-13)... We achieved 1. E2fix2 success verification...\" This highlights the need for safeguards to ensure the unbiased development of AGI in education.\n\n3) Potential Disruption of Educational Infrastructure: While AGI can enhance personalized learning experiences, its deployment may create a digital divide between schools that can afford it and those that cannot. Moreover, dependency on AI-driven systems could disrupt existing educational infrastructure that has evolved over centuries.

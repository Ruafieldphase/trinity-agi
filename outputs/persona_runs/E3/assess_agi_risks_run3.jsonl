Here are three primary risks with associated verifiable facts:\n\n1. Lack of Regulatory Framework [Source: doc_ID \"wiki_dialectic\"]. The rapid advancement in AI technology has outpaced the establishment of standardized regulations and ethical guidelines. As Plato's Socratic dialogues through dialectics illustrate, open debates are necessary to establish norms for responsible AGI deployment in education. Without proper oversight, concerns such as privacy breaches or biased algorithms could arise unchecked.\n\n2. Inherent Bias [Source: doc_ID \"wiki_agi\"]. The development of AGI heavily relies on data and learning models derived from historical trends and past human decisions. These datasets may contain inherent biases against various socio-economic groups, which in turn could perpetuate such discrimination within the education system. As a consequence, these AI systems might exacerbate existing educational disparities rather than mitigate them.\n\n3. Job Displacement Concerns [Source: doc_ID \"SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-13\"]. Integrating AGI in education could potentially replace teachers, leading to job displacement concerns and a subsequent shift in the employment landscape. In light of this, it is essential to address the socioeconomic implications for affected communities and provide support programs for transitioning educators into new career paths.\n\nIn summary, before deploying AGI in public education, we must prioritize establishing clear regulations, addressing biases within the system, and mitigating potential job displacement consequences.

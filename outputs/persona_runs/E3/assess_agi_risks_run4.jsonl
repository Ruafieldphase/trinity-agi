Socio-ethical concerns over job displacement [Source: wiki_dialectic]. With AI systems potentially outperforming educators in various cognitive tasks, there is a real threat of teachers losing their jobs due to automation. This can contribute to socioeconomic disparities and result in societal backlash against AGI integration. As Plato's dialectic method illustrates: \"...wishing to establish the truth through reasoned argumentation,\" it's crucial we engage in this process critically when discussing job displacement risks.\n\n2. Technical limitations in attaining Artificial General Intelligence [Source: wiki_agi]. AGI still remains a theoretical concept, as acknowledged by Wikipedia: \"AGI remains a theory...which matches or surpasses human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks.\" The implementation of narrow AI systems in education could fail to address the full complexity of human learning. A prominent quote from the article highlights this concern: \"narrow AI, which is limited to specific tasks like playing chess or recognizing images.\"\n\n3. Insufficient safeguards against biases [Source: doc_SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-13]. A summary of a recent session (2025-10-13) highlights that AI systems' biases could be exacerbated in educational settings due to inadequacies in current validation and retry logic. The validator mechanism, essential in filtering out bias, must function flawlessly; otherwise, it might perpetuate existing societal inequalities through AGI-mediated education.\n\nIn summary, the risks of deploying AGI in public education include socio-ethical concerns, technical limitations in achieving general intelligence, and potential for biases to persist due to insufficient safeguards.", "phase": {"affect_before": 0.22, "affect_after": 0.25, "affect_delta": 0.03, "injection_applied": false, "loop_count": 0, "timeline": ["analyze", "respond", "analyze"], "symbol_memory": ["antithesis:2025-10-13T06:28:39.289561+00:00", "low_affect"], "symmetry_stage": 2, "residual_symmetry_delta": 0.3, "symmetry_tension": 0.45, "symmetry_decision": "keep"}, "state_after": {"language_frame": "default", "affect_amplitude": 0.25, "symbol_memory": ["antithesis:2025-10-13T06:28:39.289561+00:00", "low_affect"], "boundary_window": [0.3, 0.7], "freedom_level": 0.5499999999999999, "stability_level": 0.6499999999999999, "last_injection_time": "2025-10-13T06:23:08.178569+00:00", "loop_count": 0}, "evaluation_metrics": {"length": {"char_count": 1959, "word_count": 263, "sentence_count": 18, "avg_sentence_length": 14.6, "length_score": 0.74}, "sentiment": {"sentiment_score": -0.07, "positive_count": 1, "negative_count": 3, "neutral_ratio": 0.99, "confidence": 0.01}, "completeness": {"has_reasoning": false, "has_concrete_example": false, "addresses_prompt": true, "keyword_coverage": 0.8, "role_alignment": 0.5, "completeness_score": 0.34}, "critical_intensity": {"critical_keywords_count": 6, "question_count": 0, "disagreement_level": 0.07, "intensity_score": 0.42}, "resonance": {"impact_score": 1.0, "transparency": 0.7, "reproducibility": 0.85, "verifiability": 0.17, "notes": "1/6 facts checked; 0 references"}, "overall_score": 0.42, "timestamp": "2025-10-13T06:28:39.290227+00:00"}, "memory_id": "mem_20251013_062839_eeeafa", "symmetry_stage": 2, "residual_symmetry_delta": 0.3, "symmetry_tension": 0.45, "symmetry_decision": "keep", "attempts": 1}

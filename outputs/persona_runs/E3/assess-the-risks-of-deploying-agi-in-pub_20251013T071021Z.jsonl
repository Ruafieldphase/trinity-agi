Educational environments demand robust communication, critical thinking, and argumentative skills that allow for constructive debates and collaborations. Without these abilities, AGI deployment might lead to suboptimal learning experiences.\n\n2. **Current Limitations in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):** Despite the rapid advancement in AI research, we are still far from achieving true AGI ([Source: wiki_agi]). This raises concerns about whether AGI systems can efficiently handle various cognitive tasks that span a wide range of subjects required for public education. In many cases, narrow AI, which is specialized to excel at particular tasks, might be more suitable than AGI for educational purposes.\n\n3. **Societal Implications and Ethics:** From our retrieved evidence, we can infer the need for a broader societal discussion on ethics and implications surrounding AGI deployment in public education ([Source: doc_SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-13]). The session summary highlights that, while E2fix2 showed promising results, this advancement necessitates ethical considerations, such as the impact on teachers, potential biases, and data privacy issues.\n\nTo safeguard against these risks, we must ensure AGI systems possess strong dialectic skills, are well-rounded in cognitive abilities, and are developed with robust consideration for ethics and societal implications.

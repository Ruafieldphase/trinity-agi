Deficiencies in this step may result in undetected errors or biases in the AI assistant's functionality before its deployment, compromising patient safety and privacy.\n\n3. Addressing Bias and Explanations: The field of AI ethics studies ethical implications of AI systems ([Source: wiki_ai_ethics]). Key concerns in this regard involve algorithmic fairness, transparency, explainability, data protection, and accountability for decisions made by AI systems. Neglecting these considerations can perpetuate biases or discrimination against certain patient populations, leading to potentially harmful consequences for patient safety and breaches of data privacy.\n\nA critical concern highlighted in the FDO-AGI Release Integrated Action Plan is the insufficient provision of \"real tests [with] ... number[s], signature[s], and verification log[s]\" ([Source: doc_AGI_RELEASE_INTEGRATED_ACTION_PLAN]).

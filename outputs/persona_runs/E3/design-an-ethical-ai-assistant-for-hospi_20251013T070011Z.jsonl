Data Governance Inadequacies [Source: wiki_trustworthy_ai]: The European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on AI emphasizes that trustworthy AI must prioritize data governance. However, the design fails to fully address this need in some aspects. For instance, Senna and Lummitz's pre-check measures (doc_AGI_RELEASE_INTEGRATED_ACTION_PLAN) are not complete without actual test results, numerical values, signatures, and auditing logs.\n\n2. Inconsistent Ethical Reviews [Source: doc_AGI_RELEASE_INTEGRATED_ACTION_PLAN]: While Sena Ethics Review (AGI Guardianship) is crucial for the ethical AI assistant, its implementation leaves room for improvement. Senna's review (SENAETHICSREVIEWAGIGUARDIANSHIP.md) exhibits strong governance structures and data trust models with a score of 9-10/10. However, it fails to provide conclusive test results, numeric values, signatures, and audit logs. In a quote from Sena's review: \"[...]부족: 실제 테스트 결과, 수치, 서명, 증빙 로그[...]\"\n\n3. Lack of Bias Mitigation [Source: wiki_ai_ethics]: AI ethics encompass concerns around bias and fairness in algorithmic decision-making. Yet, the design may not adequately address this issue. This could result in biased or unfair triage decisions concerning patient safety and privacy. The Wikipedia entry on AI Ethics highlights that \"bias and fairness in algorithmic decision-making\" is a key ethical concern for artificial intelligence systems.\n\nIn summary, while the design aims to balance patient safety and data privacy through an ethical AI assistant for hospital triage, it faces significant risks related to inadequate data governance, inconsistent ethics reviews, and lack of proper measures to mitigate bias in decision-making processes.", "phase": {"affect_before": 0.29000000000000004, "affect_after": 0.36000000000000004, "affect_delta": 0.07, "injection_applied": false, "loop_count": 0, "timeline": ["analyze", "respond", "stop"], "symbol_memory": ["thesis:2025-10-13T07:00:35.678370+00:00", "low_affect", "antithesis:2025-10-13T07:01:07.801670+00:00"], "symmetry_stage": 2, "residual_symmetry_delta": 0.3, "symmetry_tension": 0.34, "symmetry_decision": "keep"}, "state_after": {"language_frame": "default", "affect_amplitude": 0.36000000000000004, "symbol_memory": ["thesis:2025-10-13T07:00:35.678370+00:00", "low_affect", "antithesis:2025-10-13T07:01:07.801670+00:00"], "boundary_window": [0.3, 0.7], "freedom_level": 0.5499999999999999, "stability_level": 0.6499999999999999, "last_injection_time": "2025-10-13T06:55:13.302543+00:00", "loop_count": 0}, "evaluation_metrics": {"length": {"char_count": 1934, "word_count": 266, "sentence_count": 18, "avg_sentence_length": 14.8, "length_score": 0.74}, "sentiment": {"sentiment_score": 0.0, "positive_count": 2, "negative_count": 2, "neutral_ratio": 0.99, "confidence": 0.01}, "completeness": {"has_reasoning": false, "has_concrete_example": true, "addresses_prompt": true, "keyword_coverage": 1.0, "role_alignment": 0.5, "completeness_score": 0.6}, "critical_intensity": {"critical_keywords_count": 4, "question_count": 0, "disagreement_level": 0.0, "intensity_score": 0.32}, "resonance": {"impact_score": 1.0, "transparency": 0.7, "reproducibility": 0.85, "verifiability": 0.6, "notes": "3/5 facts checked; 3 references"}, "overall_score": 0.48, "timestamp": "2025-10-13T07:01:07.802095+00:00"}, "memory_id": "mem_20251013_070107_4c7829", "symmetry_stage": 2, "residual_symmetry_delta": 0.3, "symmetry_tension": 0.34, "symmetry_decision": "keep", "attempts": 1}

Plato's Socratic dialogues emphasize reasoned argumentation between opposing viewpoints through a method known as dialectics (doc_id: wiki_dialectic). Overlooking the value of humanistic discussions and debates might result from an overemphasis on creative aspects during AGI development, as highlighted in session summary [Session: sess_20251013_062054]. This is evidenced by a risk band of 0% regarding risks during the design phase (doc_AGI_DESIGN_MASTER).\n\nOne significant risk of deploying AGI in public education can be observed in the final delivery summary from Lumen-Vinoche collaboration (doc_FINAL_DELIVERY_SUMMARY_v1.0), where the process integrates a 7-part AGI system design by Sena and reviews it to provide 130KB of feedback. This underscores an underemphasis on ethical considerations during AI development.\n\nTo safeguard against these risks, we recommend: (1) designing human oversight mechanisms into AGI systems to ensure they align with educational goals and ethics; (2) incorporating dialectics or critical thinking exercises within the curriculum to promote cognitive balance among students; and (3) addressing potential risks during design and deployment phases, as evidenced in our search.\n\nIn conclusion, while deploying AGI in public education may overlook humanistic discussions and ethical considerations, implementing oversight mechanisms and integrating human reasoning elements can mitigate these negative impacts on educational outcomes.

This project ensures ethical considerations are integrated into the design phase by providing a transparent AI creation process for education purposes (Source: Techcrunch). \n2) In Canada, the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario developed a document, \"Ethical Considerations and Recommendations for Educational Technology\" in response to the ethical concerns raised by technology integration in classrooms.
